# IOT Traffic Light

## Equipment 
* One red, one yellow, one green led
* ~100-300 ohm resistor
* 7 jumper cables
* controller of your choice (I used a pi3)

## Pin-Mapping

### Red Light
* Jumper: Pi #5 - Breadboard a10

* LED: I10 to I11
* Jumper: I11 to ground

### Yellow Light
* Jumper: Pi #35 - Breadboard a13
* Resistor: Breadboard E13 to Breadboard F13
* LED: I13 to I14
* Jumper: I14 to ground

### Green Light
* Jumper: Pi #6 - Breadboard a17
* Resistor: Breadboard E17 to Breadboard F17
* LED: I17 to I18
* Jumper: I11 to ground

### Ground
* Jumper: Pi #38 to breadboard ground
